# üìû Phone Catalog [![Deploy](https://github.com/SantiMA10/phone-catalog/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SantiMA10/phone-catalog/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), that uses React to show a Phone Catalog and Next.js API routes as the backend for the catalog. 

## It also uses...

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as the main component library
- [jest](https://jestjs.io/) + [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) as testing framework
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) + [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure that the code follows a common style
- [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as ORM
- [zx](https://github.com/google/zx) for scripting
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) to have a MySQL instance locally
